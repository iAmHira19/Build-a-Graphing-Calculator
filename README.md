# Graphing Calculator

Welcome to the Graphing Calculator project! This project demonstrates how to create a multi-functional graphing calculator using Python and Google Colaboratory. The calculator can:

- Graph one or more functions
- Create a table of (x, y) values
- Shade areas above or below lines
- Solve and graph a system of equations
- Zoom in or out on a graph
- Solve quadratic equations

## Features

1. **Graph Functions**: Visualize one or more mathematical functions on a graph.
2. **Create Tables**: Generate tables of (x, y) values for a given function.
3. **Shade Areas**: Highlight areas above or below a function on a plot.
4. **Solve Systems**: Solve and graph systems of linear equations.
5. **Zoom**: Adjust the viewing window of the plot to zoom in or out.
6. **Quadratic Equations**: Solve quadratic equations and plot their roots.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed and set up the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy sympy pandas
